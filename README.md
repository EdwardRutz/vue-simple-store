# vue-simple-store

>An example of a simple store to manage data in Vue JS.
- The store.js holds an array of numbers and has a function to add new numbers
- The component NumberDisplay.vue displays the numbers in store.js
- NumberSubmit.vue provides the input, button and runs the function to push numbers to the array.
- The simple store can be easily upgraded to Vuex

```

## Miscellaneous Notes

#### Three ways to manage data in Vue: 

1. Event Bus (not recommended in style guide)
2. Simple Store
3. Vuex (recommended for large scale apps)

- State means data. State is the contents of memory locations, at any given point in the program's execution
